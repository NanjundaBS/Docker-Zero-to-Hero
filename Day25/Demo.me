Based on the provided source, here is a step-by-step process to demonstrate the containerization of a Django application using Docker:

1.  **Understand the Django Application Workflow (Recommended)**
    Before containerizing, it's helpful to have an idea of how the application functions. While not strictly necessary for a user just running the demo, a DevOps engineer containerizing 
   it needs this understanding. The basic workflow involves installing Django, starting a project using `django-admin startproject`, starting an application within the project using 
   `python manage.py startapp`, writing application logic in files like `views.py`, and serving content using templates configured via `urls.py`. Understanding where configurations 
   (`settings.py`), code (`views.py`), and dependencies (`requirements.txt`) are located is crucial.

2.  **Understand the Need for Containerization**
    Recognize that containerization solves the classic problem of applications working on a developer's machine but failing elsewhere due to inconsistent environments. Docker containers 
    bundle the source code, system dependencies, and required modules, ensuring the application runs consistently across different machines where Docker is installed.

3.  **The Role of the DevOps Engineer**
      As a DevOps engineer tasked with this, the responsibility is to analyze the application and **write a Dockerfile**.

4.  **Create/Analyze the Dockerfile**
     The demonstration relies on a pre-written Dockerfile. The key steps within this Dockerfile are:
    *   Choose a base image, such as Ubuntu.
    *   Set a working directory inside the container (e.g., `/app`) where the application code will reside.
    *   Copy the `requirements.txt` file (listing Python dependencies) into the working directory.
    *   Copy the application source code (e.g., the `devops` project folder) into the working directory.
    *   Install necessary software and dependencies. This includes installing Python on the Ubuntu base image, then using `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the Python 
        dependencies.
    *   Define the container's startup command using `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`. The `ENTRYPOINT` specifies the main executable (e.g., `python3`), which is typically not intended to be 
        easily overridden. The `CMD` provides default parameters for the `ENTRYPOINT` (e.g., `manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`), which can be easily overridden by the user when running 
        the container.

5.  **Obtain the Application Code and Dockerfile**
       The source mentions the Django application and its Dockerfile are available in a GitHub repository. The first practical step for someone following the demo is to **clone this 
       repository**. The link to the repository is typically found in the video description.

6.  **Navigate to the Application Directory**
       Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the specific directory containing the Django application and its Dockerfile (e.g., the `python web app` folder).

7.  **Build the Docker Image**
       Inside the directory with the Dockerfile, **build the Docker image** using the command:
       ```bash
       docker build .
       ```
      This command reads the Dockerfile and executes the steps within it to create a Docker image.
       You can verify the image was built successfully by running `docker images`.

8.  **Run the Docker Container with Port Mapping**
      To make the Django web application, which runs on port 8000 *inside* the container, accessible from your host machine and browser, you must perform **port mapping** when running 
      the container. Use the `-p` (or `-P`) flag. The command to run the container and map port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 on the host is:
      ```bash
      docker run -p 8000:8000 <image_name_or_id>
       ```
       Replace `<image_name_or_id>` with the name or ID of the image you just built. Running *without* port mapping (e.g., just `docker run -it <image>`) will start the container but the 
       web application will not be accessible from outside.

9.  **Access the Application in a Browser**
       After successfully running the container with port mapping, open a web browser and navigate to your host machine's IP address or `localhost` followed by the mapped port (e.g., 
       `http://<host_ip>:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`). The Django application should now be accessible.

10. **Troubleshoot Accessibility Issues (Firewall/Security Group)**
      If the application is still not accessible even after port mapping, especially when running on a cloud instance like AWS EC2, the issue is likely that the host machine's **security 
      group or firewall** is blocking inbound traffic on the mapped port (e.g., 8000). You need to **update the inbound traffic rules** for the security group associated with your 
      instance to allow connections to the specific port (e.g., 8000) from your desired source (e.g., your IP address or anywhere).
